## Overview

Personalize your system with Zsh-oriented dotfiles (for more advanced tab-completion features). There's a plethora of aliases and functions, and these configurations may not work for you. Nevertheless, feel free to [fork](https://github.com/kenchandev/dotfiles/fork), remove whatever you don't need and build upon that as a foundation.
